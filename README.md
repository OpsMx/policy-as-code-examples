# Policy as code examples

This repository contains a collection of sample policies that can be used with OpsMx ISD.

## Static Policy and Runtime Policy

Static policy lets users validate conditions before the start of execution, whereas Runtime policy enables users for automated decision making during execution. 

To know more about the usage of policies visit [Continuous Compliance using OpsMx ISD](https://www.opsmx.com/autopilot-overview/continuous-compliance/)

## Open Policy Agent (OPA)

OpsMx ISD uses OPA policy engine for policy definition & execution. The Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that unifies policy enforcement across the stack. OPA provides a high-level declarative language that lets you specify policy as code and simple APIs to offload policy decision-making from your software. OPA policies are expressed in a high-level declarative language called Rego. It is purpose-built for expressing policies over complex hierarchical data structures.

Rego language documentation is available here https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/
