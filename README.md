OpsMx ISD uses OPA policy engine for policy definition & execution. The Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that unifies policy enforcement across the stack. OPA provides a high-level declarative language that lets you specify policy as code and simple APIs to offload policy decision-making from your software. OPA policies are expressed in a high-level declarative language called Rego. It is purpose-built for expressing policies over complex hierarchical data structures.

Rego language documentation is available here https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/
